mpop retrieves mails from POP3 mailboxes.

Features include:
- Header based mail filtering: filter junk mail before downloading it.
- Delivery to mbox files, maildir folders, or a mail delivery agent (MDA).
  Delivery with SMTP is possible by using an appropriate MDA, for example
  msmtp.
- Fast POP3 implementation using command pipelining.
- Authentication methods USER/PASS, APOP, PLAIN, LOGIN and CRAM-MD5
  (and GSSAPI, DIGEST-MD5, and NTLM when GNU SASL is used).
- TLS/SSL encrypted connections (including server certificate verification and
  the possibility to send a client certificate).
- IPv6 support.
- Support for multiple POP3 accounts.

mpop runs on UNIX-like systems, Windows, and DOS.
In particular, supported platforms include:
GNU/Linux (glibc, uclibc or dietlibc), FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, AIX, 
HP-UX, MacOS X, OpenDarwin, Cygwin on Win32, Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003, 
MS-DOS/FreeDOS+DJGPP+Watt32.

Optional features, depending on external libraries (see the file INSTALL for
usage instructions):
- TLS/SSL support
  You need either GnuTLS >= 1.2.0 or OpenSSL >= 0.9.6 for TLS/SSL support.
  It is also possible to disable TLS/SSL support entirely.
- Additional authentication methods
  The built-in authentication code supports the USER/PASS, APOP, PLAIN, LOGIN,
  CRAM-MD5, and EXTERNAL mechanisms. When GNU SASL support is enabled, some or
  all of the mechanisms USER/PASS, APOP, EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5,
  PLAIN, LOGIN, and NTLM are available, depending on the compile-time options 
  used for libgsasl. GNU SASL >= 0.2.4 is required.
- Support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)
  You need GNU Libidn if you want this.
- Native language support (NLS)
  On systems other than GNU/Linux, you need GNU gettext if you want NLS.
