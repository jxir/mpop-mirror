mpop runs on a wide variety of platforms. It needs little more than an ANSI C
compiler and Berkeley-style sockets. It does not require any additional libraries,
but it can use the following to enhance its feature set:
- GnuTLS. The GnuTLS library provides TLS support. It is highly recommended.
  OpenSSL can be used as an alternative to GnuTLS, but this is discouraged.
- GNU SASL. Using the GNU SASL library adds support for some exotic
  authentication methods. You really only need it if you want to use GSSAPI.
- GNU libidn2. On modern Linux systems with recent glibc and GnuTLS
  libraries, mpop has automatic support for Internationalized Domain Names
  (IDN). On other systems, IDN support is available via libidn2.
